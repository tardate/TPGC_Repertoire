# My TPGC Repertoire Collection

This is my collection of transcriptions for pieces played by the [Toa Payoh Guitar Club](http://tpgc.org/wp/).

I do not claim copyright over any of these works. I simply made a fair transcription into a digital format for the purposes of study and practice.

The master works are in Guitar Pro 6 format (gpx). For some pieces that use multiple voices in the transcription, I have included copies in Guitar Pro 3 format (gp3), as these are often better handled by some software like [Go PlayAlong](http://www.goplayalong.com/) and [TuxGuitar](http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/). But note that it necessarily means the gp3 versions are not always 100% accurate with respect to note duration.
